Easy to Integrate chess game

## How to use

Usage is as simple as
- Creating an instance of the Chess::Game class
- Using Chess::Game::legalMoves() to see valid moves of the given piece
- Calling Chess::Game::move() to move the given piece

The Chess::Game class doesn't handle user interaction. For an example on how to do that
see examples/GUI/

### NOTE

This isn't the most idiot proof solution because
- Chess::Game::move() doesn't actually do any validation. It is assumed that only moves generated by Chess::Game::legalMoves() are used.
- Things like en passante don't work when player order is dishonored.

## Plans

- Finish the chess game logic
- Add support for computer player
- Create a netcat based chess game
- Optimize
