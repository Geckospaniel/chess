Easy to Integrate chess game

## How to use

Clone the repository.
If you're going to use examples/online/, run `git submodule update --init`

Usage is as simple as
- Include `chess/Game.hh`
- Creating an instance of the `Chess::Game` class
- Use `Chess::Game::legalMoves()` to see valid moves of the given piece
- Call `Chess::Game::move()` to move the given piece

The Chess::Game class doesn't handle user interaction. For an example on how to do that
see examples/GUI/

### NOTE

This isn't the most idiot proof solution because
- `Chess::Game::move()` doesn't actually do any validation. It is assumed that only moves generated by `Chess::Game::legalMoves()` are used.
- Things like en passante don't work when player order is dishonored.

## Plans

- Finish the chess game logic
- Add support for a computer player
- Optimize
